This is a very simple implementation of checker game with following restrictions -

- No capturing moves.
- No kings. When a piece reaches the end of the board it’s done and it stays in that position

## How to build

In the project directory, you can run:

npm install

This will install the dependencies. After that you can build and run and the app using following commands -

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
